# A note about torch: We would prefer >=1.11. But for our users installing dwi_ml on ComputeCanada, as
# is often the case in our lab, torch 1.10 is available only.
# Note to developers: See tmp_torch. Remove these when torch 1.11 will be available.

## Necessary but should be installed with scilpy (Last check: 01/2023, version 1.4.0):
matplotlib==2.2.*
future==0.17.*
numpy==1.21.*
scipy==1.4.*
# h5py must absolutely be >2.4: that's when it became thread-safe
h5py==2.10.*
dipy==1.5.*   # This is scilpy's current version. However, it breaks the
              # loggings. Waiting anxiously for version 1.6. Meanwhile, you can
              # manually use 1.4 instead if you want.
nibabel==3.0.*
