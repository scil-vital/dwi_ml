Getting started
===============

Downloading
===========

To use the DWI_ML toolkit you will need to clone the repository and install the
required dependencies::

   git clone https://github.com/scil-vital/dwi_ml.git

Installing dependencies
=======================

The toolkit relies on the `Scilpy`_ and `VITALabAi`_ tools maintained at the
`Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (SCIL)`_ and
`Videos & Images Theory and Analytics Laboratory (VITAL)`_ labs at the
`Université de Sherbrooke`_, and on a number of other packages available
through the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_.

We strongly recommend working in a virtual environment to install all
dependencies related to DWI_ML.

To install the `Scilpy`_ and `VITALabAi`_ tools, clone the repositories locally
and follow the instructions in the ``README`` files in each of the repositories.

To install the dependencies of DWI_ML, do::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

The toolkit heavily relies on deep learning methods. As such, a GPU device will
be instantiated whenever one is available. DWI_ML uses `PyTorch`_ as its deep
learning back end. Thus, in order to use DWI_ML deep learning methods you will
need to take a few additional steps.

1. Verify that your computer has the required capabilities in the
*Pre-installation Actions* section at `cuda/cuda-installation-guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html>`_
(sections 2.1 - 2.4). To find your OS version and the available GPU, check the
*About* menu in your computer settings.

Follow the download instructions at `nvidia.com/cuda-downloads <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_.
Choose the environment that fits your system in the selector. You can choose
*deb(local)* for the installer type. Follow the installation instructions.

2. Install `PyTorch`_. Use the selector under the *Start locally* section at
`pytorch.org/get-started <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ to have
the specific command line instructions to install `PyTorch`_ with `CUDA`_
capabilities on your system.

Perform the suggested verifications to make sure that both `CUDA`_ and
`PyTorch`_ have been correctly installed.

Installing the toolkit
======================

If you want to install the toolkit on your machine or your virtual environment,
as a user you should type::

   python setup.py install

If you want to develop DWI_ML you should type::

   python setup.py develop
