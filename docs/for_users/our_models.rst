Our models
==========

Our library currently only offers two models, both for the task of tracking in the brain, but it could eventually hold models for other tasks.

Denoising models
----------------

Coming soon: Autoencoder (AE) model!

Tractography models
-------------------

For more explanation on how to use models for tracking, see :ref:`user_tracking`.

Learn2track (l2t)
*****************
This is a refactored version of the code prepared by authors of `Poulin2017 <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66182-7_62>`_.

            :width: 500

To use this model, run script `l2t_track_from_model`.

TractographyTransformers (tt)
*****************************

This uses transformers and should be the subject of an upcoming publication.

      ToDo: Add picture

To use this model, run script `tt_track_from_model.py`.
