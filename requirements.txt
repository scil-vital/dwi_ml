## Necessary but should be installed with scilpy (Last check: 03/2022, version 1.2.2):
matplotlib==2.2.*
numpy==1.21.*
scipy==1.4.*
# h5py must absolutely be >2.4: that's when it became thread-safe
h5py==2.10.*
dipy==1.5.*   # This is scilpy's current version. However, it breaks the
              # loggings. Waiting anxiously for version 1.6. Meanwhile, you can
              # manually use 1.4 instead if you want.
nibabel==3.0.*





# --------------- Notes to developers
# 1. If we upgrade torch, verify if code copied in
#    models.projects.transformers_from_torch has changed.
